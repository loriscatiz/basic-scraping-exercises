# Basic Scraping Exercises

I did these exercises to start learning web scraping with Python.

- Exercise 1: Get the title and links from a Wikipedia page  
- Exercise 2: Extract quotes and authors from quotes.toscrape.com  
- Exercise 3: Collect quotes from multiple pages  

These are just small practice scripts to get familiar with requests and BeautifulSoup.
